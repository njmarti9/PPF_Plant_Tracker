# PPF Plant Tracker

1. What the Project Does:
This app was made to manage various plants for a friend's company. It allows for various plants with all their relevant information to be added into a firebase database and stored for later.
Normal functionality such as add/delete/search for plants is available. There are various roles for employers available to limit functionality to various roles creating distinctions between 
managers and regular employees. Accounts for the app are managed through firebase, and a seperate application is able to manage the roles of employees. 

2. Who is it for:
The app was made to replace a friend's company's pen and paper solution to record-keeping of various plants they have in their warehouses. The app is tailored fairly specifically to their needs
for what the project should do.

3. Reason it was built:
The app was coded to be expandable to fit various need of other companies if the app were to become bigger. It was built with multiple companies in mind with how the database was setup and how the
logins worked for the app. Any dispensary that needed a better management solution for their inventory would be able to pickup this app and use it to manage everything cleaner and easier.

4. How to use it:
The app (while not entirely finished) can be demo'd using android version 10 on android studio. If you would like to view the database then there are demo credentials below in order to mess
